# Abstract

We present results of using a basic binary classification neural network model to identify likely catastrophic
outlier photometric redshift estimates of individual galaxies. The classification is based on individual galaxy
redshift probability distributions generated by a multiclass classifier neural network and a support vector machine.
Importantly, the redshift probability distributions used as input to the binary classifier can be used for photometric
redshift estimates generated by a different method. We find that a simple implementation of this classification
can identify a very large fraction of galaxies with catastrophic outlier photometric redshift estimates while falsely
categorizing only a much smaller, in some cases negligible, fraction of non-outliers. These methods can reduce
the errors introduced into science analyses by catastrophic outlier photometric redshift estimates.
